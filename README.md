# RubyToDoList

This repo contains a bunch of beginner projects in Ruby that I've been doing to help me learn the language.
I wouldn't suggest trying to learn anything from my code because it doesn't use a lot of Ruby's unique features and syntax
symbols and unless and its wierd END statements... :D
